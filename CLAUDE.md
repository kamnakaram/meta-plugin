# Meta Ads: Meta Paid Advertising Audit & Optimization Skill

## Project Overview

This repository contains **Meta Ads**, a Claude Code / Cowork skill for
comprehensive Meta paid-advertising analysis across Facebook, Instagram, Reels,
Threads, Messenger, and Audience Network. It follows the Agent Skills open
standard and the 3-layer architecture (directive, orchestration, execution).
15 sub-skills, 9 agents (5 audit + 4 creative), and 12 industry templates cover
the Advantage+ / Andromeda / GEM / Lattice delivery stack with 130+ weighted
audit checks, plus Pixel/CAPI + EMQ, Conversions API server-side tracking, and
Meta attribution deep dives.

## Development Rules

- Keep SKILL.md files under 500 lines / 5000 tokens
- Reference files should be focused; aim for under 350 lines
- Scripts must have docstrings, a CLI interface, and JSON output
- Follow kebab-case naming for all skill directories
- Agents invoked via the Task tool with `context: fork`, never via Bash
- No hardcoded credentials; use the Meta Ads connector / MCP for external API access
- All checks are Meta-specific (M-series IDs); the catalog is the single source of truth

## Data Sources

Works with manually provided data (Ads Manager exports, Events Manager
screenshots, pasted metrics) or, when the official **Meta Ads connector** is
attached (Settings → Connectors → Meta), reads the account live. See
`meta-ads/references/mcp-integration.md`.
