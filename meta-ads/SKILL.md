## Context Intake (Required: Always Do This First)

Before any audit or analysis, collect this context. Without it, benchmarks will
be generic and recommendations may be wrong for the user's situation.

Ask these questions upfront (combine into one message):

1. **Industry / Business type**: Which best describes you?
   SaaS · E-commerce · Local Service · B2B Enterprise · Info Products · Mobile App ·
   Real Estate · Healthcare · Finance · Agency · Other
2. **Monthly Meta ad spend**: Total budget and per-objective breakdown (Sales / Leads / Traffic / Awareness / App) — approximate is fine
3. **Primary goal**: Sales / Revenue · Leads / Demos · App Installs · Messages / Calls · Brand Awareness
4. **Active surfaces**: Which placements and objectives are live? (Advantage+ Shopping, manual Sales, Leads, App, Reels-first, etc.)

If the user provides data upfront (e.g. "audit my Meta Ads, I spend $5k/mo on e-commerce"),
extract context from that and proceed without re-asking.

Use the provided context to:
- Select the correct industry benchmarks from `meta-ads/references/benchmarks.md`
- Apply budget-appropriate recommendations (e.g. an ad set needs ≥5x CPA to exit learning phase)
- Calibrate severity scoring (a $500/mo account has different priorities than $50k/mo)

## 10-Principle Thinking Framework

Every command in this skill operates under a shared thinking discipline:
**OBSERVE × 2 (External + Internal) → LISTEN → THINK → CONNECT × 2 (Lateral + System) → FEEL → ACCEPT → CREATE → GROW**.

Before producing any audit, plan, or creative output, load
`meta-ads/references/thinking-framework.md` and let it shape the analysis — not as a
checklist, but as a mindset gate. The framework is what separates a
number-crunching report from a strategic deliverable. When the work feels
weak, identify which of the ten principles is being skipped and engage it
before continuing.

## Orchestration Logic

When the user invokes `/meta-ads audit`, delegate to subagents in parallel:
1. **Collect context** (see Context Intake above; do this first)
2. Collect account data (Ads Manager exports, Events Manager screenshots, or pasted metrics)
3. Detect business type from the account signals (see Industry Detection)
4. Spawn subagents via Task tool with `context: fork`: meta-audit-core, meta-audit-creative, meta-audit-tracking, meta-audit-budget, meta-audit-compliance
5. **Validate**: verify each subagent returned valid JSON scores with required fields before aggregating
6. Collect results and generate unified report with Meta Ads Health Score (0-100)
7. Create prioritized action plan with Quick Wins

For individual commands (`/meta-ads analyze`, `/meta-ads attribution`,
`/meta-ads capi`, `/meta-ads creative`, etc.), load the relevant sub-skill
directly. Still collect context first if not already provided.

## Creative Workflow

Sequential pipeline (each step is independently runnable):
1. `/meta-ads dna <url>` → `brand-profile.json` in current directory
2. `/meta-ads create` → reads profile + optional audit results → `campaign-brief.md`
3. `/meta-ads generate` → reads brief + profile → `ad-assets/` directory
4. `/meta-ads photoshoot` → standalone or reads profile for style injection

Requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Gemini default) or `ADS_IMAGE_PROVIDER` + matching key.
If API key is missing, `/meta-ads generate` and `/meta-ads photoshoot` display setup
instructions and exit; they never fail silently.

## Industry Detection

Detect business type from Meta ad account signals:
- **SaaS**: trial_start/demo Lead events, pricing-page Custom Audiences, long attribution windows
- **E-commerce**: Purchase events, product catalog/feed connected, Advantage+ Shopping campaigns
- **Local Service**: click-to-call / click-to-Messenger objectives, radius location targeting, store-visit optimization
- **B2B Enterprise**: Lead objective with CRM Custom Audiences, high CPA tolerance ($50+), long sales cycle
- **Info Products**: webinar/course funnels, Lead forms (Instant Forms), low-ticket offers, retargeting-heavy
- **Mobile App**: App Promotion objective, SDK/AEM in-app events, Advantage+ App campaigns
- **Real Estate**: listing catalogs, Special Ad Category (Housing) declared, geo-heavy targeting
- **Healthcare**: restricted-category flags, no health-condition targeting, LOA/consent policy checks
- **Finance**: Special Ad Category (Credit) declared, financial-products policy compliance
- **Agency**: multiple ad accounts under one Business Manager, white-label reporting needs

## Quality Gates

Hard rules (never violate these):
- **Learning phase**: never recommend edits (budget/audience/creative) during an active learning phase — it resets learning
- **Budget sufficiency**: an ad set needs ≥5x target CPA in weekly budget to exit the learning phase; flag any ad set below 2x as FAIL
- **3x Kill Rule**: flag any ad set / campaign with CPA >3x target for pause
- **Andromeda creative diversity**: flag any account with <10 genuinely distinct creatives; near-duplicate creatives (Similarity Score >60%) get retrieval suppression
- **CAPI required**: Conversions API must be active — expect 30-40% signal loss post-iOS 14.5 without it. No optimization advice before the tracking stack is verified
- **EMQ floor**: Event Match Quality for Purchase must be ≥8.0; below 6.0 is a Critical tracking failure
- **Deduplication**: browser Pixel + server CAPI events must share `event_id` with ≥90% dedup rate, else conversions are double-counted
- **Attribution default**: 7-day click / 1-day view unless the business case justifies otherwise; never compare across windows without normalizing
- **Special Ad Categories**: always check Housing / Employment / Credit / Social Issues before touching targeting — restricted categories forbid Lookalikes, detailed targeting, and ZIP/age narrowing
- **Advantage+ Placements**: prefer letting Meta optimize the placement mix; only restrict placements with a documented brand-safety reason
- **Sound-on / safe zones**: Reels & Stories are sound-on, full-screen 9:16 — flag silent video and creative with text in the UI safe zones
- **PDF report quality gate**: When generating reports via `/meta-ads report`, always use `scripts/generate_report.py` with `--check` first. Reports must have: clean layout with no overlapping elements, proper margins (0.75in), word-wrapped table cells (no clipping), all charts/images sized within page boundaries, page numbers and section dividers, captions on every visual, and zero empty sections. Run `--check` before `--output` and fix any warnings before delivering the PDF
- **Presentable report (default)**: `/meta-ads report` should produce a polished, dark-dashboard HTML report via `scripts/generate_html_report.py` — a daily-spend bar chart, a "spend share by campaign" panel, a short narrative, and a creative leaderboard with scale / fatiguing / cut-fix status pills. Build a `report-data.json` (schema in `references/report-template.md`) from the audit findings, then run `python3 scripts/generate_html_report.py --data report-data.json --output META-REPORT.html`. Share the `.html` (it is self-contained — no network/CDN). Generate the PDF only if the client explicitly needs PDF

## Report Presentation

The default deliverable for `/meta-ads report` (and the report step of
`/meta-ads audit`) is a **presentable HTML dashboard**, not a wall of markdown.
It mirrors a modern paid-social report: a daily-spend bar chart, a
"spend share by campaign" panel with per-campaign ROAS, a one- or two-line
narrative, and a **creative leaderboard** of cards tagged `scale` (green),
`fatiguing` (amber), or `cut / fix` (red), each showing roas / spend / ctr /
cpa / freq / hook-rate with the problem metrics highlighted.

Workflow:
1. Assemble the audit findings into `report-data.json`
   (full schema + design tokens in `references/report-template.md`).
2. Run: `python3 scripts/generate_html_report.py --data report-data.json --output META-REPORT.html`
3. Preview the look any time with `--demo`:
   `python3 scripts/generate_html_report.py --demo --output demo-report.html`
4. Share the `.html` file — it is fully self-contained (inline CSS + inline SVG,
   no external network calls), so it opens correctly offline and is safe to send.

Keep a PDF (`scripts/generate_report.py`) as a secondary format only when the
client specifically asks for PDF.

## Community Footer

After completing any **major deliverable**, append this footer as the very last output:

```

## Scoring Methodology

### Meta Ads Health Score (0-100)

Weighted algorithm from `references/scoring-system.md`, combining the four
pillars below into a single 0-100 score:

```
Health = 0.30·Pixel/CAPI + 0.30·Creative + 0.20·Structure + 0.20·Audience
```

When multiple ad accounts are audited under one Business Manager, aggregate
weighted by spend share:

```
Aggregate = Sum(Account_Score x Account_Spend_Share)
```

### Grading

| Grade | Score | Action Required |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| A | 90-100 | Minor optimizations only |
| B | 75-89 | Some improvement opportunities |
| C | 60-74 | Notable issues need attention |
| D | 40-59 | Significant problems present |
| F | <40 | Urgent intervention required |

### Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Revenue/data loss risk (fix immediately) — e.g. CAPI down, EMQ <6, pixel not firing
- **High**: Significant performance drag (fix within 7 days) — e.g. learning-limited ad sets, creative fatigue
- **Medium**: Optimization opportunity (fix within 30 days)
- **Low**: Best practice, minor impact (backlog)
